Goals:

1. Practice RESTful and resourceful routing techniques by creating a Theater Reservations API in Express.js.

2. Implementing a complex MongoDB schema via a real-world walkthrough of a Theater Reservations system.

3. Understand and embrace the API development process by combining nested RESTful routes with JavaScript code that interacts with MongoDB.

Why we did it this way:
-
- Associations:
  - One theater has many sessions
  - One session has many reservations


Pseudo Code:

1. Show one theater by name
  Show total seats
  Show seats available
  Show all sessions
2. Show one session by Id
  Show info
  Show all reservations
3. Show one reservation by Id
  Create one reservation
